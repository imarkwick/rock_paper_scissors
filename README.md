#Rock, Paper, Scissors

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( MAMA ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

The task is to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors app using Sinatra for them to play on the web. It must include the following features:

* the marketeer has to enter their name before the game
* the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
* the marketeer can choose one option
* the game will choose a random option
* a winner will be declared

To view the tests, run rspec from the command line;

```sh
$ rspec

To open in the browser, use rackup and go to localhost/9292;
